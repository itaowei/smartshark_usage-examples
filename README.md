# Using the SmartSHARK Database Release

This repository explains how to use our database releases such that you can create your own analysis scripts. Below, we descripe how our data can be loaded and how to run a sample analysis in Python with [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install). 

## Preparation of the Database

First, you need to prepare a local database for analysis. 

- Download a release of the SmartSHARK MongoDB. [You can find a list of releases on our Website](https://smartshark.github.io/dbreleases/). We recommend to always use the latest release. 
- Then, you must prepare the MongoDB instance where you want to host the data. A guide on how to setup a fresh MognoDB can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#install-mongodb).
- Run [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/mongorestore/) to load the data into your local database.

For example, on Ubuntu 18.04 you can achieve all this as follows for release 2.1 of the database. *This requires about 650 GB of free disk space!*

```
wget -O smartshark_2_1.agz http://141.5.100.155/smartshark_2_1.agz
# download the following archive for the small version without code clones and code metrics, which only requires about 90 GB of free disk space
# wget -O smartshark_2_1.agz http://141.5.100.155/smartshark_2_1_small.agz
```

```
# Ref: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
sudo apt-get install gnupg
curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-6.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg \
   --dearmor
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start mongod
mongorestore --gzip --archive=smartshark_1_2.agz
```

## Running the Notebook

To run our [sample analysis](https://github.com/smartshark/usage-examples/blob/main/Example-Notebook.ipynb), you only need our library [pycoshark](https://github.com/smartshark/pycoSHARK) and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) (or any other app, that can work with Jupyter Notebooks). 

For example, you could run the following commands in your Ubuntu 18.04 machine to get everything running.

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv build-essential python3-dev
git clone https://github.com/smartshark/usage-examples
cd usage-examples/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pycoshark jupyterlab
```

You can just open the notebook in the browser and run our example.
